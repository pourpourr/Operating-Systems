# Operating Systems
 ~ Developed five different programs / processes that exchanged text messages through shared memory space . Semaphores helped in ensuring data protection and avoiding deadlocks.
 
 ~ Developed a program that simulated the behavior of a memory management system that traces memory references taken from program executions. To accomplish that, the page eviction algorithms of "2nd Chance" and "LRU" were implemented
